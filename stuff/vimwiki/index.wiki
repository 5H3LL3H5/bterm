* main design UML: see hterm.pu
* Rx-Tx sequence UML: see rxrx.pu

* settings of `HTDataSrc` and `HTDataCodec`: they should return vector of `Field` instances, each field should be of some type (say, integer field is a subclass `FieldInt`), and may contain additional type-specific data. GUI should take this vector of `Field`s, display appropriate form, and get/set data. 
  More, `HTDataSrc` should have two sets of fields: one is "general", and the second one is "computer-specific". For example, baudrate is general, and port name is computer-specific.
