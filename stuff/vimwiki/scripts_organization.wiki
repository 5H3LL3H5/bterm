The codec should be defined by javascript file. It should look like:

{{{
(function() {

   var rawData;

   return {
      /* ... */
      feedRawData: feedRawData
   };


   function feedRawData(num) {
      rawData.push(num);
   };

   function reset() {
      rawData = [];
   };

   /* ... */

})();
}}}

Probably feedRawData should return handling results, or we should have different function, like getCurrentMsg(), not sure. Whatever the case, when message received,object like this should be returned:

{{{

   {
      /* TODO:
      think of it.
      probably, the structure of this object should be completely
      codec-specific, this object will be given to all handlers, and it's up
      to handlers to interpret the object of codec which they are intended
      to work with.

      For ISO14230, for example, we should have something like this:
      */
      headerData: {
         srcAddr: 0xf0,
         dstAddr: 0x10
      },
      msgData: /* this is ByteArr; read below some details */
   }

}}}

So, the script should be able to create ByteArr. I can't find in docs how would script create new QObject-s, so, the way it should work is to create something like `ByteArrFactory`, expose this object to script, and script should use methods of factory to create instances of `ByteArr`.
